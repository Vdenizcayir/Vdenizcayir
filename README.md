✔ Hi, I’m Deniz. I’m an electrical and electronics engineer.

✔ I’m interested in industrial automation and database management but I try to improve myself in all aspects, primarily software.

✔ I’m currently learning Tia Portal v14 and SQL database.

✔ I am trying to develop myself on this platform to benefit from the software while solving problems.

✔ You can send me an e-mail at vdenizcayir64@gmail.com .
